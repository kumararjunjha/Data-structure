    "# Data Types and Structures Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
    "Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data to enable efficient access and modification. They are important because they optimize operations \n",
    "like searching, sorting, and data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n",
    "- **Mutable** data types can be changed after their creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries).\n",
    "  #Example:\n",
    "  my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "  my_list[0] = 10  # Mutates the list\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutable** data types cannot be changed after their creation (e.g., strings, tuples).\n",
    "  #Example:\n",
    "  my_string = \"hello\"\n",
    "  try:\n",
    "      my_string[0] = \"H\"  # Raises an error\n",
    "  except TypeError:\n",
    "      print(\"Strings are immutable.\")\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
    "- Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable.\n",
    "- Lists use more memory than tuples.\n",
    "- Tuples are generally faster to iterate over compared to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
    "Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs. Internally, they use hash tables for fast lookup, insertion, and deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
    "Sets automatically remove duplicate values and allow for fast membership checks, making them ideal for cases where unique elements are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
    "A string is a sequence of characters, whereas a list is a sequence of elements (which can be of any type). Strings are immutable, while lists\n",
    "are mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
    "Tuples are immutable, which means their data cannot be altered. This ensures the data remains consistent and unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
    "A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. Python dictionaries use hash tables internally for efficient\n",
    "key-value pair storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
    "Yes, lists in Python can contain elements of different data types.\n",
    " #Example:\n",
    "my_list = [1, \"hello\", 3.14]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
    "Strings are immutable to ensure data consistency, reduce memory usage through interning, and make them safe for use as dictionary keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
    "Dictionaries provide fast lookups using keys, while lists require searching through elements, which is slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
    "Tuples are preferable when the data should not change, such as representing geographical coordinates or settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
    "Sets automatically discard duplicate values.\n",
    " #Example:\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3}\n",
    "print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
    "For lists, `in` checks for membership among elements. For dictionaries, `in` checks for the presence of keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n",
    "No, tuples are immutable, so their elements cannot be modified after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.\n",
    "A nested dictionary is a dictionary within another dictionary. It can be used to represent hierarchical data.\n",
    " #Example:\n",
    "nested_dict = {\"user1\": {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}, \"user2\": {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
    "Accessing an element in a dictionary has an average time complexity of O(1) due to the use of hash tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
    "Lists are preferred when the data is ordered, and sequential access is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
    "Dictionaries (prior to Python 3.7) do not maintain the order of insertion. However, in Python 3.7+, they maintain insertion order but\n",
    "are still accessed using keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
    "- Lists use indices to retrieve elements, which requires knowing the position.\n",
    "- Dictionaries use keys to retrieve values, which is faster and more intuitive for key-value mappings.\n"
